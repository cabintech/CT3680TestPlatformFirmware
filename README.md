# CT3680TestPlatformFirmware
This repo contains the firmware (microcontroller C code) that acts as a bridge between the CT3680TestPlatformUI and the hardware. This code directly interacts with hardware components on the PCB (including the CT3680 module under test) to implement all the hardware related functions needed for the testing process.
